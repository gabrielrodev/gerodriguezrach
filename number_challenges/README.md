# Number Challenges

This project contains two Python scripts demonstrating basic looping, conditional logic, and numerical analysis.

## Files

### `part1_multiples.py`
- Prints multiples of 9 below 99
- Finds numbers divisible by both 3 and 7 under 500
- Calculates the sum of numbers between 200–400 divisible by 17

### `part2_random_stats.py`
- Generates 50 random integers (1–100)
- Calculates:
  - Count of numbers between 42–61 (inclusive)
  - Highest and lowest values

## Skills Demonstrated
- Loops and conditional logic
- Use of modulo operations
- Random number generation
- List manipulation and analysis
- Clean formatted output
