# Stack vs Heap Memory

A C program demonstrating the difference between **stack** and **heap** memory allocation using arrays.

## Features
- Allocates arrays dynamically using `malloc` (heap)
- Uses local arrays (stack)
- Compares performance and memory handling
- Simple educational breakdown for beginners

## Language
- C (with `stdlib.h` and `stdio.h`)

## Notes
This was part of a college-level C programming assignment.

ðŸ’¡ Great for interviews, understanding memory, and showing basic C skills.
